        <span>Dear Betu,</span>
        <br />
        From the day we met, you became my safe place, my happiest moment, my closest friend. Your presence makes my
        world brighter, your laughter is my favorite melody. I cherish every memory we share, every conversation, every
        small moment that means everything.

        I know weâ€™re best friends, and I respect that, but my heart whispers something deeper. No matter what, you will always hold
        a special place in my heart.
        <br />

          Forever Yours,
